This is a simple **Python-based console application** that allows users to calculate the area of various geometric shapes, including:

- Rectangle 🟥
- Square 🟦
- Triangle 🔺
- Circle 🟠
- Parallelogram 🟫

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
- Users are asked to select a shape by typing the **first letter** (e.g., `R` for Rectangle).
- After selection, the user enters the necessary dimensions.
- The program calculates and displays the **area rounded to 2 decimal places**.

## 🧮 Supported Formulas

| Shape         | Formula                              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Rectangle     | `Area = length × width`              |
| Square        | `Area = side²`                       |
| Triangle      | `Area = ½ × base × height`           |
| Circle        | `Area = π × radius²`                 |
| Parallelogram | `Area = base × height`               |
